#Intro

This week is a soft intro to the course. We will explore rudimentary concepts of developing a solution to a problem.

Basically in this week we will do two assignments. By doing these assignments we will come to terms to the environment in which the assignments must be completed.

Each assignment will contain a problem statement, a starter folder and a solution folder. The problem statement will contain the details of the problem and the sample input/outputs. The starter folder will contain a solution with relevant test cases and skeleton code. You are expected to take the code in the starter folder and develop the solution to satisfy all the test cases. The solution folder will contain a working solution.
