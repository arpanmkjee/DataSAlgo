#Intro

In this module you will learn that programs based on efficient algorithms can solve the same problem billions of times faster than programs based on na√Øve algorithms. You will learn how to estimate the running time and memory of an algorithm without even implementing it. Armed with this knowledge, you will be able to compare various algorithms, select the most efficient ones, and finally implement them as our programming challenges!
